SMELT Documentation
***************************************

This section documents the development of Salish Model Ecosystem - Lower Trophic (SMELT), 
an ecosystem model for the Salish Sea. SMELT was derived from the 1-D SOG model and implemented in 3-D, 
coupled to NEMO, using PISCES as a template.

SMELT is implemented as a configuration of NEMO version 3.6 (revision 6770 as of March 8, 2017). 
The base NEMO 3.6 code and associated documentation can be accessed through the NEMO official site: http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/

Files that are modified from the base code are stored within our SMELT configuration directory in the MY_SRC subdirectory. 
These files are not currently publicly available.
