Working on :kbd:`nefos`
***********************

.. warning::

    This section contains work in progress notes.
    `nefos`_ is not yet ready to run the Salish Sea NEMO model.

These are working notes about the process of getting the Salish Sea NEMO model set up to run on  the `Ocean Newworks Canada`_ private cloud computing facility `nefos`_ that run on `OpenStack`_.

.. _Ocean Newworks Canada: http://www.oceannetworks.ca/
.. _nefos: https://www.westgrid.ca/support/systems/Nefos
.. _OpenStack: http://www.openstack.org/

The `OpenStack dashboard`_ provides a web interface to provision and report on cloud resources.
The :kbd:`nefos` dashboard is at https://nefos.westgrid.ca/dashboard/.

.. _OpenStack dashboard: http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/ch_dashboard.html

Authentication and authorization for :kbd:`nefos` is managed by `Westgrid`_,
so use your Westgrid user id and password to log in to the dashboard.

Web Interface
=============

Initial setup was done via the https://nefos.westgrid.ca/dashboard/ web interface with guidance from the
(unpublished at time of writing)
`nefos.westgrid.ca Quickstart Guide`_ and the `OpenStack End User Guide`_.

.. _nefos.westgrid.ca Quickstart Guide: https://www.westgrid.ca/support/quickstart/nefos_openstack _cloud_quick start_guide
.. _OpenStack End User Guide: http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/openstack_user_guide.html

The project (aka tenant) name for the the Salish Sea NEMO model is :kbd:`NEMO`.

The network configuration was done for us by ONC.
The configuration from the :guilabel:`Network` section of the web interface is recorded here for reference.

Images
------

An Ubuntu Server 14.04 image was loaded via the :guilabel:`Compute > Images > Create Image` button with the following parameters:

* Name: ubuntu-server-14.04-amd64
* Description: Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit for Salish Sea NEMO project
* Image Source: Image Location
* Image Location: http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
* Format: QCOW2 - QEMU Emulator
* Architecture: x86_64
* Minimum Disk (GB): blank
* Minimum RAM (MB): blank
* Public: Yes
* Protected: Yes


Access & Security
-----------------

Generate an ssh key pair on a Linux or OS/X system using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $HOME/.ssh/
    $ ssh -t rsa -f nefos_id_rsa -c <yourname>-nefos

Assign a string passphrase to the key pair when prompted.
Passphraseless keys have their place,
but they are a bad idea for general use.

List the public key with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat nefos_id_rsa.pub

and use copy-paste to import it into the web interface via the :guilabel:`Compute > Access & Security > Key Pairs > Import Key Pair` button.

Use the :guilabel:`Compute > Access & Security > Security Groups > Manage Rules` button associated with the :guilabel:`default` security group to add security rules to allow :command:`ssh` and :command:`ping` access to the image instances.

:command:`ssh` Rule:

* Rule: SSH
* Remote: CIDR
* CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0

:command:`ping` Rule:

* Rule: ALL ICMP
* Direction: Ingress
* Remote: CIDR
* CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0


Instances
---------

Use the :guilabel:`Compute > Instances` section of the web interface to manage instances.

To launch an instance to use as a login node use the :guilabel:`Launch Instance` button.
On the :guilabel:`Details` tab set the following parameters:

* Availability Zone: nova
* Instance Name: manage
* Flavor: m1.small
* Instance Count: 1
* Instance Boot Soure: Boot from image
* Image Name: ubuntu-server-14.04-amd64

On the :guilabel:`Access & Security` tab set the following parameters:

* Key Pair: the name of the key pair that you imported
* Security Groups: default enabled

.. note::

    If only 1 key pair has been imported it will be used by default.
    If there is more than 1 key pair available,
    one must be selected.
    Only 1 key can be loaded automatically into an instance on launch.
    Additional public keys can be loaded once an instance is running.

On the :guilabel:`Networking` tab ensure that :guilabel:`NEMO-network` is selected.

Click the :guilabel:`Launch` button to launch the instance.

Once the instance is running use the :guilabel:`More > Associate Floating IP` menu item to associate a public IP address with the instance.


:command:`ssh` Access
=====================

Log in to the publicly accessible instance with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/nefos_id_rsa ubuntu@<ip-address>

The first time you connect to an instance you will be prompted to accept its RSA host key fingerprint.
You can verify the fingerprint by looking for the :kbd:`SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINT` section in the instance log in the :guilabel:`Instances > Instance Details > Log` tab.
If you have previously associated a different instance with th IP address you may receive a message about host key verification failure and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
To resolve the issue delete the prior host key from your :file:`$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` file.
The message will tell you what line it is on.

You will also be prompted for the pasphrase that you assigned to the ssh key pair when you created it.
On Linux and OS/X authenticating the ssh key with your pasphrase has the side-effect of adding it to the :command:`ssh-agent` instance that was started when you logged into the system.
You can add the key to the agent yourself with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/nefos_id_rsa

You can list the keys that the agent is managing for you with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh-add -l

You can simplify logins to the instance by adding the following lines to your :file:`$HOME/.ssh/config` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    Host nefos
        Hostname        <ip-address>
        User            ubuntu
        IdentityFile    ~/.ssh/nefos_id_rsa
        ForwardAgent    yes

With that in place you should be able to connect to the instance with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh nefos

Command-line Interface
======================

To automate creation and management of cloud resources OpenStack provides a collection of `command-line clients`_.
There is also a `Python Software Development Kit (SKD)`_.
The SDK implements Python bindings to the OpenStack API,
which enables you to perform automation tasks in Python by making calls on Python objects rather than making REST calls directly.
All OpenStack command-line tools are implemented using the Python SDK.

.. _command-line clients: http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/ch_cli.html
.. _Python Software Development Kit (SKD): http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/ch_sdk.html


Local System Setup
------------------

To isolate the installation of the OpenStack command-line clients and the Python SDK on our local machine
(Waterhole workstation,
laptop,
etc.)
we'll use a `Conda environment`_.
This presumes that you have the :ref:`AnacondaPythonDistro` installed on your local machine.

.. _Conda environment: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html

At the time of writing OpenStack only supports Python 2.7,
so create and activate an environment with Python 2.7 and `pip`_ installed:

.. code-block:: none

    $ conda create -n nefos python=2.7 pip
    ...
    $ source activate nefos

.. _pip: https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Install a collection of packages that the command-line clients and SDK depend on and that are included in the Anaconda distribution.
Doing this avoids compilation and linking issues.

.. code-block:: none

    (nefos)$ conda install requests pyopenssl six pytz crytography cffi pycparser
