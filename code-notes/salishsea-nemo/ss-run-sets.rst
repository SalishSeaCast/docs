*************************
Salish Sea Run Sets Files
*************************

The collection of NEMO namelist,
:program:`salishsea` command processor run description,
and NEMO output server control files used to run NEMO for the Salish Sea are maintained in the :ref:`SS-run-sets-repo` repo.

We choose to call these run-set files but they are also referred to as "experiments" in the NEMO community.
That term is difficult for the laboratory modelers on the Salish Sea MEOPAR team to apply to computational model runs.

The :program:`salishsea` command processor run description files are YAML_ files that are used by our :ref:`SalishSeaCmdProcessor` tool for managing NEMO runs and results.
The :ref:`RunDescriptionFileStructure` section describes the file syntax.

.. _YAML: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation

The namelist files contain collections of related namelists.
They are concatenated to form a complete namelist for a NEMO run by the :program:`salishsea` :ref:`salishsea-prepare`.

The output server control files is like those found in the :file:`EXP00/` directories of the reference configurations in the :ref:`NEMO-code-repo` repo.
