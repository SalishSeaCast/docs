netCDF4 Files Creation and Conventions
**************************************

The Salish Sea MEOPAR project uses netCDF4_ files as input for the NEMO model and for other purposes,
where appropriate.
The :ref:`netCDF4FilesCreationAndConventions` section in the :ref:`project tools documentation <SalishSeaToolsDocs>` documents the recommended way of creating netCDF4 files with compression of varibles,
limitation of variables to appropriate precision,
and appropriate metadata attributes for the variables and the dataset as a whole.
The recommendations are based on the `NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions, Version 1.6, 5 December, 2011`_.
Use of the `netCDF4-python`_ library
(included in :ref:`AnacondaPythonDistro`)
is assumed.

The :ref:`salishsea_tools.nc_tools` in the :ref:`SalishSeaTools` package is a library of Python functions for exploring and managing the attributes of netCDF files.
