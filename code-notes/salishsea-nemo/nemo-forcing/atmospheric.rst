.. _AtmosphericForcing:

*******************
Atmospheric Forcing
*******************

NEMO includes a CORE bulk formulae interface that allows the :ref:`CGRF-Dataset` to be used as atmospheric forcing
(aka surface boundary conditions; SBC).
The namelist that controls that is :kbd:`namsbc_core`.
That NEMO interface requires that all of the files
(including the :ref:`AtmosphericForcingInterpolationWeights`)
be in a single directory and have a prescribed name pattern.
To satisfy that requirement the following file management strategy has been established:

* The Salish Sea MEOPAR repository of CGRF product files and their NEMO CORE bulk interface representation reside in :file:`/ocean/dlatorne/MEOPAR/CGRF/`

* Within that directory are 2 sub-directories:

  * :file:`rsync-mirror/` is a collection of :file:`yyyy-mm-dd/` directories that contain uncompressed CGRF files for the day identified by the directory name
  * :file:`NEMO-atmos/` is a collection of symbolic links to the CGRF files using the names required by the NEMO CORE bulk interface.
    The :file:`NEMO-atmos/` directory also contains symbolic links to the :ref:`AtmosphericForcingInterpolationWeights` file and the :ref:`NoSnowConstraint` file in the :ref:`NEMO-forcing-repo` repo.

* The files in the :file:`/ocean/dlatorne/MEOPAR/CGRF/` directory are managed by the :command:`salishsea get_cgrf` tool;
  see the :ref:`salishsea-get_cgrf` docs.

* The namelist that directs NEMO to use the files in :file:`NEMO-atmos/` looks like:

  .. code-block:: fortran

        sn_wndj = 'v10',       1,          'v_wind',    .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  'Vwnd'

        sn_tair = 't2',        1,          'tair',      .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_humi = 'q2',        1,          'qair',      .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_prec = 'precip',    1,          'precip',    .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_snow = 'no_snow', -12,          'snow',      .false., .true.,  'yearly','met_gem_weight.nc',  ''

        cn_dir      = 'NEMO-atmos/'  ! root directory for the location of the bulk files
        ln_2m       = .true.         ! air temperature and humidity referenced at 2m (T) instead 10m (F)
      /

  The file name roots and the variable names come from the CGRF files.

* The directory given in as value associated with the :kbd:`atmospheric` key in the :kbd:`forcing` section of the run description file is symlinked as :file:`NEMO-atmos` in the run directory to complete the chain from the namelist to the CGRF products files:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      forcing:
        atmospheric: /ocean/dlatorne/MEOPAR/CGRF/NEMO-atmos/


.. _NoSnowConstraint:

No-Snow Constraint
==================

The NEMO CORE bulk interface requires a snow file but it has been decided to impose a constraint on the Salish Sea model whereby all precipitation falls in liquid phase.
That constraint is provided by the :file:`atmospheric/no_snow.nc` file in the :ref:`NEMO-forcing-repo` repo.
That file ensures that the solid phase precipitation is zero at all times and locations.
It is used as annual climatology forcing in the :kbd:`namsbc_core` name list.


.. _AtmosphericForcingInterpolationWeights:

Interpolation Weights
=====================

JP Paquin created a weights file that allows NEMO's Interpolation On the Fly
(IOF)
feature to be used to take atmospheric forcing values from the :ref:`CGRF-Dataset`.
It is in the :file:`4_weights_ATMOS/` directory of the 2-Oct-2013 WC3_PREP tarball and has been added to the :ref:`grid-directory` of the :ref:`NEMO-forcing-repo` repo.
Those weight values were subsequently used to create a netCDF4 weights file with :kbd:`zlib` compression enabled and CF-1.6 conventions compliant attributes using the `I_ForcingFiles/Atmos/netCDF4weights-CGRF.ipynb`_ notebook.

.. _I_ForcingFiles/Atmos/netCDF4weights-CGRF.ipynb: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/I_ForcingFiles/Atmos/netCDF4weights-CGRF.ipynb


Creating New Weights Files
--------------------------

The :program:`NEMO_Preparation/4_weights_ATMOS/get_weight_nemo` program in the :ref:`NEMO_EastCoast-repo` repo can be used in conjunction with a bathymetry file and atmospheric forcing file(s) to create a weights file that allows NEMO's Interpolation On the Fly
(IOF)
feature to use the atmospheric forcing values.
An example of the use of :program:`get_weight_nemo` to create a weights file for datasets from the operational West deployment of Environment Canada's `High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System`_ (HRDPS) is presented here:

.. _High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System: http://weather.gc.ca/grib/grib2_HRDPS_HR_e.html

Clone the :ref:`NEMO_EastCoast-repo` repo on :kbd:`salish` and edit the :file:`NEMO_Preparation/4_weights_ATMOS/make.sh` file to comment out the default build commands and enable the :kbd:`salish` ones:

.. code-block:: bash

    #- On salish (UBC)
    LIBNETCDF=/usr
    mpif90 -c grid.f90 -I${LIBNETCDF}/include -L${LIBNETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf
    mpif90 -c map.F90 -I${LIBNETCDF}/include -L${LIBNETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf
    mpif90 -c get_weight_nemo.F90 -I${LIBNETCDF}/include -L${LIBNETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf
    mpif90 -o get_weight_nemo get_weight_nemo.o map.o grid.o -I${LIBNETCDF}/include -L${LIBNETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdff

Build :program:`get_weight_nemo`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./make.sh

:program:`get_weight_nemo` creates a file of weighting factors that allow atmospheric forcing variable values on one grid to be interpolated on to the model grid
(as defined in the bathymetry dataset).
To do that it requires:

#. a bathymetry dataset,
   the name of which is hard-coded to :file:`bathy_meter.nc`
#. a namelist file,
   the name of which is hard-coded to :file:`namelist`,
   and an example of which is contained in the :file:`NEMO_Preparation/4_weights_ATMOS/` directory
#. one or more atmospheric forcing dataset file(s),
   the name of which is defined in the namelist

The output of :program:`get_weight_nemo` is a weights file,
the name of which is hard-coded to :file:`met_gem_weight.nc`.

We'll run :program:`get_weight_nemo` in :file:`NEMO-forcing/grid/`,
so start by copying the sample namelist file to there,
changing to that directory,
and symlinking it as :file:`namelist`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp namelist ../../../NEMO-forcing/grid/namelist.get_weight_nemo.gem2.5-ops
    $ cd ../../../NEMO-forcing/grid/
    $ ln -s namelist.get_weight_nemo.gem2.5-ops namelist

Symlink the bathymetry dataset as :file:`bathy_meter.nc`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s bathy_meter_SalishSea2.nc bathy_meter.nc

The only values that :program:`get_weight_nemo` actually uses from the atmospheric forcing dataset file is the grid point locations,
but the namelist file is more complicated.
We can reduce the complexity by using a single atmospheric forcing dataset file as a climatology,
so we symlink one as :file:`atmos.nc`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s /ocean/sallen/allen/research/Meopar/Operational/oper_allvar_ss_y2014m09d23.nc atmos.nc

Next,
edit the namelist file to point to that symlink:

.. code-block:: fortran

    !-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    &namsbc_core !   namsbc_core  CORE bulk formulea
    !-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    !            ! file name ! variable   ! clim  ! 'yearly'/
    !            !           !  name      ! (T/F) ! 'monthly'
       sn_wndi   = 'atmos',   'u_wind'   , .true., 'yearly'
       sn_wndj   = 'atmos',   'v_wind'   , .true., 'yearly'
       sn_qsr    = 'atmos',   'solar'    , .true., 'yearly'
       sn_qlw    = 'atmos',   'therm_rad', .true., 'yearly'
       sn_tair   = 'atmos',   'tair'     , .true., 'yearly'
       sn_humi   = 'atmos',   'qair'     , .true., 'yearly'
       sn_prec   = 'atmos',   'precip'   , .true., 'yearly'
       sn_snow   = 'atmos',   'snow'     , .true., 'yearly'
       cn_dir    = './'      !  root directory for the location of the bulk files
    /

The important things here are:

* The file name must match the name of the atmospheric forcing dataset file symlink,
  without the :file:`.nc` extension.
* The climatology field (:kbd:`clim (T/F)`) must be set to :kbd:`.true.` for all variables.
* The value of :kbd:`cn_dir` must be :kbd:`'./'`.

Finally,
run :program:`get_weight_nemo`:

.. code-block:: bash

    ../../eastcoast/NEMO_Preparation/4_weights_ATMOS/get_weight_nemo

The output should be something like::

   sbc_blk_core : flux formulattion for ocean surface boundary condition

and a :file:`met_gem_weight.nc` file should be created.

Use the `I_ForcingFiles/Atmos/ImproveWeightsFile.ipynb`_ notebook to transform :file:`met_gem_weight` into a netCDF4 file called :file:`weights-2.5kmGEM-ops.nc` with well-structured metadata
(see :ref:`netCDF4FilesCreationAndConventions`).

.. _CGRF-Dataset:

CGRF Dataset
============

The Canadian Meteorological Centre's
(CMC)
Global Deterministic Prediction System
(GDPS)
Reforecasts
(CGRF)
dataset is a relatively high-resolution forcing dataset for ocean models [Smith_etal2013].
The dataset is hosted on an :program:`rsync` server at :kbd:`goapp.ocean.dal.ca`.
User id and password credentials are required to access it.

At the command line you can explore the dataset with commands like:

.. code-block:: bash

.. _Pressure-Correction:

Pressure Correction
====================

The CGRF atmospheric model uses a terrain following vertical coordinate system which means that the lowest grid cells are not at sea level in mountainous regions such as those surrounding the Salish Sea.
As such, we have developed an algorithm to adjust CGRF pressure files to sea level.
Given the altitude :math:`z_1`,  temperature :math:`T_1` and pressure :math:`p_1` of an air parcel, we can estimate the sea level pressure as [Holton 1992]:

First, the altitude of each grid cell is computed since this is not given in the CGRF output.
Given the of an air parcel, we can approximate its height :math:`z_1` above sea level using the following formula [Holton, 1992]:

.. math::
   p_s = p_1\left(\gamma\frac{z_1}{T_1} +1 \right)^\frac{g}{\gamma R}

where :math:`g` is the acceleration due to gravity, :math:`R` is the ideal gas constant, and :math:`\gamma` is the temperature lapse rate of the atmosphere (0.0098 degrees/m).

To arrive at this formula we have made a few assumptions:

1. The atmopshere is in hydrostatic equilibrium: :math:`\frac{d p}{d z} = -\rho g`
2. The atmosphere is an ideal gas: :math:`p = \rho R T`
3. The temperature of the atmosphere decreases with height at a constant rate: :math:`\frac{dT}{dz} = -\gamma`

The altiude of each grid cell is stored in a file :file:`altitude_CGRF.nc` in the :file:`tools/I_ForcingFiles/Atmos` repository.

Ths sea level pressure calculation is performed in :file:`nc_tools.generate_pressure_file`, which is used in `get_cgrf`_ to correct pressure files on download.
Corrected pressure files are named :file:`slp_corr_y0000m00d00.nc`.
See the `tools docs`_ for details on :file:`nc_tools.generate_pressure_file` method..
