.. _AtmosphericForcing:

*******************
Atmospheric Forcing
*******************

NEMO includes a CORE bulk formulae interface that allows the :ref:`CGRF-Dataset` to be used as atmospheric forcing
(aka surface boundary conditions; SBC).
The namelist that controls that is :kbd:`namsbc_core`.
That NEMO interface requires that all of the files
(including the :ref:`AtmosphericForcingInterpolationWeights`)
be in a single directory and have a prescribed name pattern.
To satisfy that requirement the following file management strategy has been established:

* The Salish Sea MEOPAR repository of CGRF product files and their NEMO CORE bulk interface representation reside in :file:`/ocean/dlatorne/MEOPAR/CGRF/`

* Within that directory are 2 sub-directories:

  * :file:`rsync-mirror/` is a collection of :file:`yyyy-mm-dd/` directories that contain uncompressed CGRF files for the day identified by the directory name
  * :file:`NEMO-atmos/` is a collection of symbolic links to the CGRF files using the names required by the NEMO CORE bulk interface.
    The :file:`NEMO-atmos/` directory also contains symbolic links to the :ref:`AtmosphericForcingInterpolationWeights` file and the :ref:`NoSnowConstraint` file in the :ref:`NEMO-forcing-repo` repo.

* The files in the :file:`/ocean/dlatorne/MEOPAR/CGRF/` directory are managed by the :command:`salishsea get_cgrf` tool;
  see the :ref:`salishsea-get_cgrf` docs.

* The namelist that directs NEMO to use the files in :file:`NEMO-atmos/` looks like:

  .. code-block:: fortran

        sn_wndi = 'u10',       1,          'u_wind',    .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  'u_wind'
        sn_wndj = 'v10',       1,          'v_wind',    .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  'v_wind'
        sn_qsr  = 'qsw',       1,          'solar',     .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_qlw  = 'qlw',       1,          'therm_rad', .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_tair = 't2',        1,          'tair',      .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_humi = 'q2',        1,          'qair',      .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_prec = 'precip',    1,          'precip',    .true.,  .false., 'daily', 'met_gem_weight.nc',  ''
        sn_snow = 'no_snow', -12,          'snow',      .false., .true.,  'yearly','met_gem_weight.nc',  ''

        cn_dir      = 'NEMO-atmos/'  ! root directory for the location of the bulk files
        ln_2m       = .true.         ! air temperature and humidity referenced at 2m (T) instead 10m (F)
      /

  The file name roots and the variable names come from the CGRF files.

* The directory given in as value associated with the :kbd:`atmospheric` key in the :kbd:`forcing` section of the run description file is symlinked as :file:`NEMO-atmos` in the run directory to complete the chain from the namelist to the CGRF products files:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      forcing:
        atmospheric: /ocean/dlatorne/MEOPAR/CGRF/NEMO-atmos/


.. _NoSnowConstraint:

No-Snow Constraint
==================

The NEMO CORE bulk interface requires a snow file but it has been decided to impose a constraint on the Salish Sea model whereby all precipitation falls in liquid phase.
That constraint is provided by the :file:`atmospheric/no_snow.nc` file in the :ref:`NEMO-forcing-repo` repo.
That file ensures that the solid phase precipitation is zero at all times and locations.
It is used as annual climatology forcing in the :kbd:`namsbc_core` name list.


.. _AtmosphericForcingInterpolationWeights:

Interpolation Weights
=====================

JP Paquin created a weights file that allows NEMO's Interpolation On the Fly
(IOF)
feature to be used to take atmospheric forcing values from the :ref:`CGRF-Dataset`.
It is in the :file:`4_weights_ATMOS/` directory of the 2-Oct-2013 WC3_PREP tarball and has been added to the :ref:`grid-directory` of the :ref:`NEMO-forcing-repo` repo.
Those weight values were subsequently used to create a netCDF4 weights file with :kbd:`zlib` compression enabled and CF-1.6 conventions compliant attributes.


.. _CGRF-Dataset:

CGRF Dataset
============

The Canadian Meteorological Centre's
(CMC)
Global Deterministic Prediction System
(GDPS)
Reforecasts
(CGRF)
dataset is a relatively high-resolution forcing dataset for ocean models [Smith_etal2013].
The dataset is hosted on an :program:`rsync` server at :kbd:`goapp.ocean.dal.ca`.
User id and password credentials are required to access it.

At the command line you can explore the dataset with commands like:

.. code-block:: bash

    rsync <userid>@goapp.ocean.dal.ca::canadian_GDPS_reforecasts_v1/2002/2002091500
    Password:
    dr-xr-xr-x        4096 2012/06/14 06:59:22 2002091500

and

.. code-block:: bash

    rsync <userid>@goapp.ocean.dal.ca::canadian_GDPS_reforecasts_v1/2002/2002091500/
    Password:

Note that the trailing slash causes the contents of a directory to be accessed while its absence refers to the directory itself.

To make a local copy of files use the :kbd:`-rltv` options and provide a destination directory
(which will be created if it doesn't already exist):

.. code-block:: bash

    rsync -rltv <userid>@goapp.ocean.dal.ca::canadian_GDPS_reforecasts_v1/2002/2002091500/ 2002-09-15/

The local files are created with :kbd:`555` permissions.
Make them user and group writable so that they can be decompressed,
and non-executable with:

.. code-block:: bash

    chmod 664 2002-09-15/*
