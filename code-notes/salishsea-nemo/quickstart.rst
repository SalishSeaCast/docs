*****************
Quick Start Guide
*****************

This section describes *very* briefly the steps to set up and run the Salish Sea NEMO code.
Details of what this all means and why the steps below are what they are can be found in subsequent sections.


Create a Workspace
==================

You can all your workspace directory whatever you want so here we're going to call it :file:`MEOPAR`.

Most runs of the model will be done on :kbd:`salish` and the :file:`/data/` partition should be used there:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /data/<userid>/MEOPAR

Development and analysis work will probably be done on one of the :kbd:`ocean`-cluster workstations where storage is under the :file:`/ocean/` NFS mount:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /ocean/<userid>/MEOPAR

On a :kbd:`westgrid.ca` machine or your laptop you would similarly create a :file:`MEOPAR/` directory in an appropriate file system location.

All of the following steps assume that you are in the :file:`MEOPAR/` directory
(or its equivalent if you have chosen a different name).

Create directories for the temporary directories that are created to run the model,
and to receive results files from runs.
We'll call them :file:`SalishSea/` and :file:`Salishsea/results/`:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p SalishSea/results


Clone the Repos
===============

Assuming that you are using SSH key authentication on Bitbucket
(see :ref:`vc-with-hg`),
clone the :ref:`NEMO-code <NEMO-code>`,
:ref:`NEMO-forcing <NEMO-forcing>`,
:ref:`SS-run-sets <SS-run-sets>`,
:ref:`tools <tools-repo>`,
and :ref:`docs <docs-repo>` repos:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-code NEMO-code
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-forcing NEMO-forcing
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/ss-run-sets SS-run-sets
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/docs


Install Tools and Command Processor Packages
============================================

Assuming that you have the :ref:`AnacondaPythonDistro` installed,
install the :ref:`SalishSeaTools` and :ref:`SalishSeaCmdProcessor` Python packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd tools/SalishSeaTools
    pip install -e .
    cd ../SalishSeaCmdProcessor
    pip install -e .


Compile the Code
================

Assuming that you are working on :kbd:`salish`,
compile and link the full domain Salish Sea NEMO configuration and the IOM output server with the :kbd:`salish` architecture definitions with the compilation distributed over 8 cores.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG
    ./makenemo -n SalishSea -m salish -j8

The resulting executables are located in :file:`NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/SalishSea/BLD/bin/`.


Prepare a Run
=============

The :file:`SS-run-sets/` :ref:`SS-run-sets-SalishSea` contains version controlled sample run description files and namelist segment files.
Edit or copy and edit those files to define the run that you want to execute then use :program:`salishsea` :ref:`salishsea-prepare` to create a temporary run directory containing all of the appropriate files and symbolic links:

.. code-block:: bash

    salishsea prepare SalishSea.yaml iodef.xml

That command will provide the relative path and name of the temporary run directory,
something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    Created run directory ../../SalishSea/4361797c-530f-11e3-ae1d-0025909a8461


Run the Model
=============

Assuming that you are running the model with a 4x4 MPI domain decomposition,
go to the temporary run directory and run the model:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../../SalishSea/4361797c-530f-11e3-ae1d-0025909a8461
    mpiexec -n 16 ./nemo.exe > stdout 2> stderr &

A convenient command to monitor the memory use of a run and its time step progress is:

.. code-block:: bash

    watch -n 5 "(free -m; cat time.step)"


Collect the Run Results
=======================

When the run is finished,
and assuming that you are still in the temporary run directory,
combine the pre-processor netCDF run results files and gather the rest of the run results files into a directory for analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

    salishsea combine --no-compress SalishSea.yaml ../results/my_excellent_results
    mv layout.dat NEMO-code_tip.txt NEMO-forcing_tip.txt namelist ocean.output solver.stat stderr stdout time.step ../results/my_excellent_results/

Unless you have a reason to keep it around,
the temporary run directory can be deleted at this point.
