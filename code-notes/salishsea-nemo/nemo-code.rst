********************
NEMO-code Repository
********************

These notes describe the Salish Sea MEOPAR project `NEMO-code`_ repository and its maintenance.
They are a narrative guide to the Mercurial log and diffs that can be obtained from the repository itself or via the Bitbucket interface.

.. _NEMO-code: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-code

The `NEMO-code`_ repo is a Mercurial repository in which is maintained the merger of the trunk of the main NEMO :command:`svn` repository and the changes made by the Salish Sea MEOPAR project team.

.. note::

    The `NEMO-code`_ repository is a private repository for members of the Salish Sea MEOPAR project team.
    That is because it contains parts of the NEMO_ codebase.
    Although that codebase is openly licensed it's developers require registration_ to access the code.

    If you have completed that registration and would like access to the `NEMO-code`_,
    please contact `Susan Allen`_,
    the Salish Sea MEOPAR project leader.

Getting the Code
================

Team members using SSH key authentication on Bitbucket may clone the `NEMO-code`_ repo with:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-code NEMO-code

For password authentication use:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone https://<you>@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-code NEMO-code

where :kbd:`<you>` is your Bitbucket user id.


Managing Configurations
=======================

To create a new configuration based on,
for example,
`AMM12`_ use:

.. _AMM12: http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/Using-NEMO/Configurations/AMM

.. code-block:: bash

    cd NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG
    ./makenemo -r AMM12 -n MY_AMM12 -m salish -j8 add_key "key_netcdf4 key_nosignedzero"

That will use the existing :kbd:`AMM12` configuration as a basis to build a new configuration called :kbd:`MY_AMM12` with the :kbd:`salish` architecture definitions and with compilation distributed over 8 cores.
The C Pre-Processor (CPP) keys :kbd:`key_netcdf4` and :kbd:`key_nosignedzero` will be added to configurations.
The resulting configuration,
including a compiled and link NEMO executable,
is located in :file:`NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/MY_AMM12`.

See :command:`./makenemo -h` for details of options and sub-commands.

In addition to the collection of architecture definitions that the NEMO consortium provides,
the `NEMO-code`_ repo includes definitions for:

* :kbd:`ifort_jasper`: MPI builds on :kbd:`jasper.westgrid.ca`
* :kbd:`salish`: MPI builds on :kbd:`salish.eos.ubc.ca`
* :kbd:`ocean`: single processor builds on UBC-EOAS :kbd:`ocean` cluster workstations and :kbd:`salish`


Running the Model
=================

We don't want to clutter the `NEMO-code`_ repo with files from development and eploreation run-sets
(aka experiments),
run results,
etc.,
so runs are done in directories outside the :file:`NEMO-code/` tree.
To create a run-sets directory copy the :file:`EXP00/` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/MY_AMM12
    cp EXP00 ../../../amm12_runs

The input files for `AMM12`_ need to be downloaded and unpacked in the run-set directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd amm12_runs
    wget http://dodsp.idris.fr/reee512/NEMO/amm12_inputs_v3_4.tar
    tar xvf amm12_inputs_v3_4.tar
    gunzip *.nc.gz

Edit the :kbd:`&nammpp` section of the :file:`namelist` file to set the number of cores to use:

.. code-block:: fortran

    jpni        =   4       !  jpni   number of processors following i (set automatically if < 1)
    jpnj        =   4       !  jpnj   number of processors following j (set automatically if < 1)
    jpnij       =   16      !  jpnij  number of local domains (set automatically if < 1)

Run the model on 16 cores:

.. code-block:: bash

    /usr/bin/mpiexec -n 16 ./opa


.. _NEMO-MirrorMaintenance:

NEMO :command:`svn` Repo Mirror Maintenance
===========================================

The :file:`/ocean/sallen/hg_repos/NEMO-hg-mirror` repository is an :command:`svn` checkout of http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo/svn/branches/2012/dev_v3_4_STABLE_2012 and also a read-only Mercurial repository.
It was initialized with:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /ocean/sallen/hg_repos
    svn --username "dlatornell" co -r 3819 http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo/svn/branches/2012/dev_v3_4_STABLE_2012
    hg init NEMO-hg-mirror
    cd NEMO-hg-mirror
    cat > .hgignore
    .svn
    DOC/NEMO_book.pdf
    ctrl-d
    hg add
    hg ci -m"Initialize NEMO svn mirror at r3819 of ^/branches/2012/dev_v3_4_STABLE_2012."

:command:`svn` v1.7.5 was used on :kbd:`salish` for the :command:`svn` part of the initialization.


.. _PullChangesFromNEMOsvn:

Workflow to Pull Changes from NEMO :command:`svn` Repo
------------------------------------------------------

.. todo::

    Write Workflow to Pull Changes from NEMO :command:`svn` Repo


Workflow to Merge :kbd:`trunk` and Salish Sea Revisions
-------------------------------------------------------

Merging changes from NEMO :kbd:`trunk` and the Salish Sea central `NEMO-code` repo on Bitbucket is done in a repo that is used for only that purpose.
Doug does the merges on his laptop.
The repo in which the merging is done was created by cloning the :file:`/ocean/sallen/hg_repos/NEMO-hg-mirror` repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone ssh://sable.eos.ubc.ca//ocean/sallen/hg_repos/NEMO-hg-mirror NEMO-mirror-merge

and setting the paths in its :file:`.hg/hgrc` to:

.. code-block:: ini

    [paths]
    bb = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-code
    default-push = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-code
    mirror = ssh://sable.eos.ubc.ca//ocean/sallen/hg_repos/NEMO-hg-mirror

Those paths mean that the repo for :command:`hg pull` and :command:`hg incoming` commands must be specified explicitly.
The :kbd:`bb` and :kbd:`mirror` paths are provided to facilitate pulling from `NEMO-code`_ on Bitbucket and :file:`/ocean/sallen/hg_repos/NEMO-hg-mirror`,
respectively.
:command:`hg push` and :command:`hg outgoing` commands will act on the `NEMO-code`_ repo,
unless otherwise specified.

After the :ref:`PullChangesFromNEMOsvn` has been completed those changes from `NEMO-code`_ are pulled and updated into :kbd:`NEMO-mirror-merge`,

.. code-block:: bash

    cd NEMO-mirror-merge
    hg pull --update bb

The changes from :file:`/ocean/sallen/hg_repos/NEMO-hg-mirror` are also pulled and updated into :kbd:`NEMO-mirror-merge`,
resolving any merge conflicts as necessary:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg pull --update mirror

Finally,
the result of the updates and merges is pushed to `NEMO-code`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg push bb

If other users have pushed changes to `NEMO-code`_ while merge conflicts were being handled :command:`hg pull --rebase` can be used to bring in those changes and deal with any additional merge conflicts.
