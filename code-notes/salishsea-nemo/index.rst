Salish Sea NEMO
***************

This section documents the NEMO code and supporting files used to model the Salish Sea.

The information about the NEMO-3.1 and CONCEPTS-110 reference repos is included here because some code from CONCEPTS-110 is used in our model and CONCEPTS-110 is based on NEMO-3.1.
Those repos are not used for model runs.
