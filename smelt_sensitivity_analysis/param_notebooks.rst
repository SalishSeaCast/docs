SMELT Sensitivity Analysis: Parameter Notebooks
=======================


Batch notebook creation:

For every parameter there are 6 simulation results, each created using a different value for that parameter. The purpose of this type of notebook is to take an in-depth look at the differences between these results. Three types of plots are used:

    Heatmap of tracer concentration against depth and time for a particular parameter value


    Heatmap of the difference between tracer concentrations for two different runs against depth and time


    Facetplot showing tracer concentration vs. time at certain depths, with a coloured line for each of the six parameter values
