SMELT Sensitivity Analysis: Introduction
========================================

SMELT (Salish Model Ecosystem- Lower Trophic) is a one dimensional biological model (SOG) coupled to a physical model of the Salish Sea (NEMO). This model tracks the interactions and movement of several types of plankton and nutrients.

In the model parameters are used to describe things like plankton growth functions, sinking rates, mortality rates, light requirements and nutrient requirements. There are over one hundred biological parameters with values that have been chosen based on related research.

A sensitivity analysis was performed on this model to better understand the impact of individual parameter choices on model results. These pages describes the methodology used and current findings.

The analysis was performed by modifying one parameter at a time and comparing the results. Parameter notebooks and metric functions were used to qualitatively and quantitatively examine the impact of these changes.
