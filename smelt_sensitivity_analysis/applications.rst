SMELT Sensitivity Analysis: Applications
========================================

The results of this analysis can be used to tune the full model to better match observational data.

An example use case is a discrepancy found between measured and predicted nitrate concentrations at 20m depth at several locations in the Salish Sea.

There already exists a large dataset of 5x5 model results. To determine what parameters are most useful to tune a 'Nitrate at 20m' metric is created.
This metric is defined as the integral of Nitrate between 15 and 25 metres depth for all times of the model run.
