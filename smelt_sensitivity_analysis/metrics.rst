SMELT Sensitivity Analysis: Metrics
=======================

Metrics are used to quantitatively compare all of the parameters. This provides a useful overview of how the parameters affect certain parts of the simulation.

An example of a metric would be peak primary producer biomass. This is defined as the maximum value of a three day running average of total primary producer biomass in the model domain. For every model result this metric can be calculated. 

Then we can see how the value of this metric changes for different parameter modifications. This metric can be thought of as a function with inputs of parameter values and a single valued output. Under this paradigm we can define partial derivatives
