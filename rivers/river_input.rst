River input 
======================================================================================================

River input provides a significant volume of freshwater to the Salish Sea and can influence stratification, circulation and primary productivity. We need to parametrise the rivers that flow into the Salish Sea throughout the domain. 

Morrison et al. (2011) provides a method for estimating freshwater runoff in the Salish Sea region based on precipitation. We acquired the exact data from Morrison, which includes the runoff volumes for each watershed for each year from 1970 to 2012, as well as monthly averages.

* For BC, maps of rivers can be found on the Atlas of Canada - `Toporama site <http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/index.html>`_.

* For some areas of BC, maps of watersheds that include rivers where wild steelhead live are available from the `BCCF <http://www.bccf.com/steelhead/watersheds.htm>`_ .

* In Washington, maps of watersheds are available `here <http://www.ecy.wa.gov/apps/watersheds/wriapages/>`_.

From these maps, the percentage of the watershed that each river drains can be estimated.
