Environmental Drivers of Spring Bloom Timing
********************************************

The SalishSeaCast Nemo model is a 3 dimensional coupled biophysical model of the Salish Sea.
The model includes many interacting variables, from important physical oceanography dynamics to 
biological food web structure, with macrozooplankton being the highest grazing pressure.

This analysis utilized data from the 201905 model hindcast to determine the major environmental factors that affect 
the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom in different locations of the Salish Sea. Once the variables were extracted, 
the relationships between interannual variation of bloom timing and various environmental conditions were visually examined 
via time series plots. Factors that displayed visual correlation were then further investigated with correlation and 
linear regression analysis.
