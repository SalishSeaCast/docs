Environmental Drivers of Spring Bloom Timing
********************************************

SalishSeaCast is a 3-dimensional NEMO-based coupled biophysical model of the Salish Sea. 
The model includes many interacting processes, from important physical oceanography 
dynamics to a biological food web structure, with mesozooplankton as the highest trophic level. 

This analysis utilized data from the 201905 model hindcast to determine the major 
environmental factors that affect the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom in different 
locations of the Salish Sea. Once time series were extracted, the relationships between 
interannual variation of bloom timing and various environmental conditions were visually 
examined. A suite of factors were then further investigated with correlation and linear regression 
analysis.

The following pages outline the methodology used and the relevant findings.
