Central SoG Bloom Timing Analysis (Station S3)
==============================================

Station S3 is a location off the central/south east coast of Vancouver Island. It was chosen as 
the first location to examine in order to compare to the results of a previous environmental driver 
analysis of spring bloom timing based on a 1-dimensional model [1]_ that served as a starting 
point from which the present 3-dimensional implementation was developed.

A time series of phytoplankton concentrations, environmental forcings and bloom timing at 
Station S3 from 2007-2020 can be found in this notebook_. The environmental drivers were 
averaged over each month for January, February and March. It was found that the most 
significant relationships between bloom date and drivers occurred in March. This is apparent for 
solar radiation (Figure 1), as well as other bloom date versus environmental driver plots found in 
this time series notebook_. Although a strong negative relationship between March zooplankton concentrations and bloom timing was observed, it was decided to not explore that 
correlation further, as the variation in zooplankton concentration was likely a direct result of the 
timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom.

   **Figure 1.** Correlation between monthly averaged solar radiation and bloom timing 
   according to three different metrics. The bottom three plots show that the highest R-squared 
   values of the regression between bloom date and average solar radiation occurs in March, 
   relative to the regressions for January and February. 

Next, correlation, residuals analysis and multiple linear regression (Table 1) were done on 
environmental forcings and bloom timing. The notebook can be found here_. By looking at 3 
correlation plots between bloom date and environmental driver averages for January, February 
and March, the most significant correlations were once again seen in the March averages 
(Figure 2).

It was found that the most correlated driver with bloom date was wind speed cubed, with 
turbocline depth being a close second. While turbocline depth has strong correlations with 
bloom timing, it is also very highly correlated with wind speed variability. Due to the causal 
relationship between wind speeds and turbocline depth through wind driven mixing, our 
interpretation is that wind is the key environmental driver in this location. There is a strong 
positive relationship between wind and bloom timing because stronger wind leads to increased 
mixing near the surface (Figure 4). When phytoplankton are mixed to greater depth, their 
average exposure to light is reduced, leading to slower growth and a delayed bloom. 
Additionally, the surface phytoplankton concentration is reduced through dilution. In contrast, 
early stratification allows phytoplankton to remain concentrated near the surface and be 
exposed to greater light 
levels than when mixed to greater depths, leading to an earlier bloom.

   and bloom dates (right axis) according to three different metrics. The lines connecting the    
   interannual variability in wind speed cubed hold no meaning, and are simply present to easily 
   distinguish between the environmental driver and the bloom date.

   **Figure 4.** Correlation between March average wind speed cubed and spring phytoplankton 
   bloom timing according to three different metrics. A positive relationship is observed between 
   this environmental driver and bloom timing. 

The next strongest correlation with bloom timing was solar radiation. Higher solar radiation 
(reduced cloud cover) in March exposes phytoplankton to greater light levels, which promotes 
faster growth and, consequently, an earlier bloom (Figure 1). Additionally, solar radiation 
increases near-surface temperature. Solar radiation is strongly anti-correlated with wind, 
meaning years with low winds also experience high solar radiation. These combining effects 
have a strong influence on bloom development.

   **Figure 5.** Time series from 2007-2020 of monthly averaged solar radiation (left axis) and 
   bloom dates (right axis) according to three different metrics. The lines connecting the 
   interannual variability in solar radiation hold no meaning, and are simply present to easily 
   distinguish between the environmental driver and the bloom date. 

Temperature itself was the third environmental condition that was highly correlated with bloom 
timing at station S3. Temperature is influenced by, and therefore correlated with, the previously 
discussed factors of wind speed and solar radiation. Additionally, surface temperature itself can 
influence bloom timing in multiple ways. All biological rates in the model have temperature 
dependence. Phytoplankton growth rates increase at warmer temperatures, but so do grazing 
and mortality. However, during the spring bloom period, a time of net primary production, the 
increase in phytoplankton growth rate at warmer temperatures can be expected to outweigh the 
increase in loss terms. Lower dominant zooplankton biomass has been observed during warmer 
years, which would decrease grazing pressure on phytoplankton and result in an earlier bloom 
[2]_. Although temperature can affect stratification due to vertical differences in density, the 
effects are small compared to the temperature dependence on the rates of mortality, grazing 
and growth [1]_.

   temperature (left axis) and bloom dates (right axis) according to three different metrics. The 
   lines connecting the interannual variability in surface temperature hold no meaning, and are 
   simply present to easily distinguish between the environmental driver and the bloom date.

   **Figure 7.** Correlation between March average surface conservative temperature and spring 
   phytoplankton bloom timing according to three different metrics. A negative relationship is 
   observed between this environmental driver and bloom timing.  

Another possible tertiary environmental driver for spring bloom timing at station S3 is the Fraser 
river input. Although the Fraser flow initially had a weak correlation with bloom timing, residual 
analysis showed that when wind or solar radiation effects were subtracted, there was a strong 
negative relationship of the residuals with Fraser flow (Figure 8). The Fraser river is the most 
significant single source of freshwater to the Salish Sea. When Fraser flow rates are high in 
March, it creates strong stratification between low salinity surface waters and high salinity deep 
waters. Similarly to the effects of wind, this stratification allows phytoplankton to be mixed at 
shallower depths, which exposes them to more light and results in fast growth and an early 
bloom. Although mid-depth nitrate concentrations (30-90m) had high correlations with bloom 
timing, it was determined from examining a time series that the variation of this environmental 
factor likely resulted from rather than drove bloom timing.

   **Figure 8.** Correlation between March average Fraser river flow and spring phytoplankton 
   bloom timing according to three different metrics (grey dots). Correlation between March average Fraser river flow and the residuals from regression of March wind speed cubed and bloom timing according to three different metrics (coloured dots). A negative relationship is observed between this environmental driver and bloom timing. This signifies that when the variability from wind is subtracted, a strong relationship between Fraser flow and bloom timing is observed.

In summary, this analysis identifies the four strongest environmental drivers of spring 
phytoplankton bloom timing at Station S3. The primary driver was found to be wind speeds, the 
secondary driver was solar radiation, and sea surface temperatures and Fraser flow rates were 
found to be equally strong tertiary drivers. This is partially consistent with the findings of Collins 
et. al (2009), which determined through analysis of a 1-D model at Station S3 that the primary 
driver of the spring bloom was wind speed, with solar radiation being a secondary driver [1]_. 
They did not, however, find any effect from surface temperatures or Fraser input on 
phytoplankton bloom timing, whereas the present analysis did identify a strong impact from both 
of these factors. The effect of the Fraser River was parameterized in Collins et al. (2009) but is 
more fully represented in the present model, which could be a leading cause in this discrepancy.
