Station S3 Bloom Analysis
=========================

Station S3 is a location off the central/south east coast of Vancouver Island. It was chosen as 
the first location to examine in order to compare to the results of a previous environmental driver 
analysis of spring bloom timing from a one dimensional model at this location. [1]_

A time series of phytoplankton concentrations, environmental forcings and bloom timing at 
Station S3 from 2007-2020 can be found here. (201905 environmental drivers) The 
environmental drivers were averaged over each month for January, February and March. It was 
found that the most significant relationships between bloom date and drivers occurred in March 
(Figure 2). Although zooplankton concentrations were examined in this part of the analysis, it 
was decided to not explore that relationship further, as zooplankton concentrations were likely 
more dependent on bloom time than the other way around.

Next, correlation, residuals analysis and multiple linear regression were done on environmental 
forcings and bloom timing. By looking at 3 correlation plots between bloom date and 
environmental driver averages for January, February and March, the most significant 
correlations were once again seen in the March averages.

It was found that the most correlated driver with bloom date was wind speed cubed, with 
turbocline depth being a close second. Through further investigation, it was determined that 
turbocline was likely a direct result of wind, and it was therefore decided to only consider wind 
as a key environmental driver. There is a strong positive relationship between wind and bloom 
timing because reduced wind in late winter/early spring reduces wind driven mixing in the 
surface layer, which sets up strong stratification and creates a shallower mixing layer. This early 
stratification allows phytoplankton to be exposed to greater light levels than when mixed to 
greater depths, and allows an earlier bloom to occur. The next strongest correlation with bloom 
timing was solar radiation. Higher solar radiation (reduced cloud cover) in March exposes 
phytoplankton to greater light levels, which promotes faster growth and, consequently, an earlier 
bloom. The third environmental condition that was highly correlated with bloom timing at station 

S3 was surface temperature. Cooler temperatures reduce phytoplankton growth rates, so years 
with warmer temperatures in late winter/early spring will promote fast growth and early blooms. 
Another possible tertiary environmental driver for spring bloom timing at station S3 is the Fraser 
river input. Although the Fraser flow initially had a weak correlation with bloom timing, residual 
analysis showed that when wind and solar radiation was taken out of the equation, there was 
quite a strong negative relationship with the spring bloom. The Fraser river is the most 
significant single source of freshwater to the Salish Sea. When Fraser flow rates are high in 
March, it creates strong stratification between low salinity surface waters and high salinity deep 
waters. Similarly to the effects of wind, this stratification allows phytoplankton to be mixed at 
shallower depths, which exposes them to more light and results in fast growth and an early 
bloom.

In summary, this analysis identifies the four strongest environmental drivers of spring 
phytoplankton bloom timing at Station S3. The primary driver was found to be wind speeds, the 
secondary driver was solar radiation, and sea surface temperatures and Fraser flow rates were 
found to be equally strong tertiary drivers. This is partially consistent with the findings of Collins 
et. al (2009), which determined through analysis of a 1D model at Station S3 that the primary 
driver of the spring bloom was wind speed, with solar radiation being a secondary driver. [1]_ 
They did not, however, find any effect from temperatures or Fraser input on phytoplankton 
bloom timing, whereas the present analysis did identify a strong impact from both of these 
factors.
