Frequency Sensitivity Studies
***********************************************

The model produces datasets containing information about the velocity field for a region. Ariane uses this information to produce particle trajectories. We wanted to know at what frequency would the NEMO output need to be to produce reliable particle trajectories.

How different would the trajectory of a particle be if it were generated by model data at a 30 minute frequency compared to that generated by data at a 1 hour frequency? What if the model data has a longer frequency, say 4 hours?

For the frequency sensitivity studies, we used model data at 30 minute, 1 hour, and 4 hour frequencies and produced particle trajectories with positions at 30 minute intervals. We did this for particles starting their trajectories at the Fraser River, at various points along the thalweg, and in areas between Haro Strait and the Strait of Juan de Fuca where there is strong vertical mixing.
