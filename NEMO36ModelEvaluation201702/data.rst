ONC nodes
=======================================

Refer to `tidal current comparison <http://salishsea-meopar-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tidalcurrents/tidal_current_comparison.html>`_.

ONC ferries
======================================

Since 2012, BC Ferry has been with ONC instruments to collect data. 
This data was recently made available on the salishsea erdapp server.
Data collected include temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, turbidity and other variables along with their standard deviation and sample count. 
This particular ferry travlled from Tsawwassen to Duke Point (and back), crossing the Fraser River plume region.
The data is collected every 1 minute.

Citizen Science 
======================================

The Salish Sea Marine Survival Project, with the support of the Pacific Salmon Foundation, have volunteer citizen scientists to take CTD casts and water samples at various stations in the Strait of Georgia. 
Data collected include temperature and salinity for all stations and nitrate, silicon, and chloryphyll for select stations.
These trips take place between Febuary and October and was done for 2015, 2016, and 2017. 
The stations are grouped by region, wchcih include Lund, Powell River, Irvine, Baynes Sound, Nanaimo, Campbell River, Steveston, Victoria, Cowichan Bay, and Ladysmith. 
The raw data was processed by Rich and additional edits were made by Colin of PSF and Elise.

Fraser Plume CTD casts
======================================

Three boat trips, lead by Elise, were made to take CTD casts and collect water samples of the Fraser River Plume on April 10, 2017, May 31, 2017, and November 1, 2017, thus spanning the different seasons in a year. 
Data collected include pressure, temperature, salinity, beam transmission, PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), flurescence, oxygen, and turbidity. 
Processing of the water sample was done at (ask Elise) 
Using loadDataFRP from SalishSeaTools, a choice of the raw data, slightly cleaned up data, and data interpolated to the Salish Sea model depths can be loaded. 
 

Water quality buoy
======================================

A water quality buoy, maintained by Enviroment Canada and the BC Ministry of Enviroment, is located in the Fraser River.
The raw data was processed by Rich and covers January 2009 to November 2017. 
Data collected include temperature, salinity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, stream velocity, and some atmospheric fields such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, humidity, and pressure.
