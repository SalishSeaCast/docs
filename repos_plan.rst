Plan for Mercurial Repositories
===============================

General
-------

* The central location for all repos will be the `SalishSea-MEOPAR team account`_ on Bitbucket

  .. _SalishSea-MEOPAR team account: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/

* People are free to push changes to code and docs that they own,
  but they should fork repos and create pull requests to provide changes to stuff owned by others so that changes are reviewed

* All repos will have issue trackers enabled on Bitbucket

* Bitbucket wikis will be disabled on all repos to force documentation into repo docs directories

* To the extent that is practical docs use Sphinx_ and are themed to match `salishsea.eos.ubc.ca`_

  .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
  .. _salishsea.eos.ubc.ca: http://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/

* Docs from public repos will be rendered as HTML under the `salishsea.eos.ubc.ca`_ domain and on readthedocs.org as an alternative;
  readthedocs also provides PDF rendering

* Docs from private repos will be rendered as HTML in password protected areas under the `salishsea.eos.ubc.ca`_ domain

.. todo::

   Add link to project page on readthedocs.org once it exists
