Anaconda Python Distribution
============================

The the Anaconda Python distribution is the easiest way to install Python and a collection of scientific libraries and other tools
(`Sphinx`_,
`IPython Notebook`_,
`NumPy`_,
`matplotlib`_,
to name a few)
that we use in the Salish Sea MEOPAR project.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _IPython Notebook: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/index.html
.. _NumPy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html
.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/contents.html

Follow the `installation instructions`_ for your operating system and accept the option at the end of the installation to make Anaconda your default Python.

Thanks to the shared storage and user configurations across all of the Waterhole machines and :kbd:`salish` each user only needs to do the installation once on a Waterhole machine for the libraries to be available on all of those machines.
There is no need to install Anaconda on the Westgrid machines.

Start a new shell session and confirm that :file:`$HOME/anaconda/bin/` is on your path.

There is one library that we use extensively that is not included in the base Anaconda installation: `netcdf4-python`_.
To install it,
do:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install netcdf4

and follow the prompts.
