Anaconda Python Distribution
============================

The Anaconda Python distribution is the easiest way to install Python and a collection of scientific packages and other tools
(`Sphinx`_,
`Jupyter Notebook`_,
`NumPy`_,
`matplotlib`_,
to name a few)
that we use in the Salish Sea MEOPAR project.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/
.. _NumPy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html
.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/contents.html

Choose the *Python 3* download from the `installation instructions`_ for your operating system,
follow the rest of those instructions,
and accept the option at the end of the installation to make Anaconda your default Python.

.. _installation instructions: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

If you are installing Anaconda Python on a Waterhole machine,
choose the *Python 3 Linux 64-bit* download.
Thanks to the shared storage and user configurations across all of the Waterhole machines and :kbd:`salish` each user only needs to do the installation once on a Waterhole machine for the packages to be available on all of those machines.
There is no need to install Anaconda on the Westgrid machines.

Start a new shell session and confirm that :file:`$HOME/anaconda3/bin/` is on your path.

There is are a few packages that we use extensively that is not included in the base Anaconda installation:

* `basemap`_
* `nbsphinx`_
* `netcdf4-python`_
* `sphinx_rtd_theme`_
* `xarray`_


.. _basemap: https://matplotlib.org/basemap/
.. _nbsphinx: https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/
.. _netcdf4-python: https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/
.. _sphinx_rtd_theme: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theme.html
.. _xarray: http://xarray.pydata.org/

To install them,
do:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install basemap hdf4 netcdf4 xarray

and follow the prompts.
Then do:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install nbsphinx
