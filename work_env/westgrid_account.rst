WestGrid is a computing resource shared by western Canadian universities. We use WestGrid for computationally intensive simulations. The large number of processors available often reduces simulation run-time considerably.

In order to use WestGrid you need an account. To create an account follow the steps on this page:

.. note::
   When prompted to select an institution, choose :kbd:`WestGrid: University of British Columbia`.

   If you are creating an account as a sponsored user ask your supervisor for their CCRI code.
