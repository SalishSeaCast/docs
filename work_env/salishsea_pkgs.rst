Salish Sea Repos and Packages
=============================

Once you have your :ref:`MercurialConfiguration` set up and the :ref:`AnacondaPythonDistro` installed and activated you need to set up a working area,
clone some Mercurial repositories,
and install some Salish Sea MEOPAR project tools.

In the working environment on your Waterhole workstation you should create a work space on the :kbd:`/ocean/` partition:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /ocean/$USER/MEOPAR

On your own laptop,
well,
the choice of where you put files is up to you...

In the work space you need to clone a number of Salish Sea MEOPAR project repos from Bitbucket.
The repos that you need depends whether the environment is for running the model,
doing analysis,
etc.;
the :ref:`QuickStartGuide` provides guidance for the repos to install in model run environments.
Here,
we'll assume that you are setting up your Waterhole machine working environment where you will be doing analysis,
documentation,
etc.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /ocean/$USER/MEOPAR/
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/docs
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-forcing NEMO-forcing

Next,
install the :ref:`SalishSeaTools` and the :ref:`SalishSeaCmdProcessor`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd tools
    pip install -e SalishSeaTools
    pip install -e SalishSeaCmd
