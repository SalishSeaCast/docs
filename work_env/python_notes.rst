Intro to Python
===============

Most of the analysis and tools in the Salish Sea MEOPAR project are written in `Python`_,
though Matlab makes occasional guest appearances.

.. _Python: http://python.org/

`This slide deck`_ from a `physics course`_ at Cornell University provides a good,
fairly detailed,
introduction to Python for people who already know at least one programming language.
Of course,
no two groups make exactly the same choices within a language and the few differences to our choices are detailed below.
Also,
don't get too bogged down in the details of object-oriented and functional programming
(especially slides 18 through 22) as we don't use those aspects much.

.. _This slide deck: http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~myers/teaching/ComputationalMethods/LectureNotes/Intro_to_Python.pdf
.. _physics course: http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~myers/teaching/ComputationalMethods/

A few differences you will see compared to our Python code:

* The Cornell course uses an older syntax for string interpolation:

  .. code-block:: python

      print ‘value of %s = %s’ % (name, val)

  In our notebooks and code you are more likely to see that spelled like:

  .. code-block:: python

      print(‘value of {n} = {v}’.format(n=name, v=val))

  or perhaps:

  .. code-block:: python

      print(‘value of {0} = {1}’.format(name, val))

* The :py:obj:`scipy.array` syntax discussed on slides 25 through 28 is a synonym for :py:obj:`numpy.ndarray` and you will see it used in our code as:

  .. code-block:: python

      import numpy as np

      a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])
      ...
      p = np.arange(0.,1.,0.1)
      etc.

* The :py:obj:`pylab` namespace mentioned on slide 31 is a Matlab-like interface to the Matplotlib_ library.
  In our code we try to use the :py:obj:`pyplot` object-oriented interface,
  so you will see things like:

  .. code-block:: python

      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      import numpy as np

      xvals = np.linspace(-10., 10., 100)
      yvals = xvals**3
      fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3)
      ax1.plot(xvals, yvals)
      ax2.plot(xvals, yvals, ‘r.’)
      ax3.hist(yvals)

Jupyter Notebook, netCDF, and Model Results
===========================================

We have an ongoing project to develop a collection of `Jupyter Notebooks`__ that provide discussion,
examples,
and best practices for plotting various kinds of model results from `netCDF`_ files.
There are code examples in the notebooks and also examples of the use of functions from the :ref:`SalishSeaToolsPackage`.

__ jupyter_
.. _jupyter: https://jupyter.org/
.. _netCDF: http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/

If you are new to the Salish Sea project,
or to `Jupyter Notebook`__,
netCDF_,
and Matplotlib_ you should read the notebooks in the following order:

__ jupyter_


* `Exploring netCDF Files.ipynb`_
* `Plotting Bathymetry Colour Meshes.ipynb`_
* `Plotting Tracers on Horizontal Planes.ipynb`_
* `Plotting Velocity Fields on Horizontal Planes.ipynb`_

ERDDAP and :kbd:`xarray`
------------------------

From late-2013 until early-2016 we used the `netCDF4-python`_ library to open locally stored files.
The notebooks above describe that way of working.
In early-2016 we set up and `ERDDAP server`_  to provide public access to our model results.
The `netCDF4-python`_ library can open datasets from ERDDAP URLs just as easily as it can open them from local files.
So,
here is a reworking of the `Exploring netCDF Files.ipynb`_ notebook using ERDDAP:

* `Exploring netCDF Datasets from ERDDAP.ipynb`_

.. _netCDF4-python: http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/
.. _ERDDAP server: https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/erddap/
.. _Exploring netCDF Datasets from ERDDAP.ipynb: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/analysis_tools/Exploring%20netCDF%20Datasets%20from%20ERDDAP.ipynb

One reason that you might want to use ERDDAP to access our model results is if you don't have access to our results files stored on the UBC EOAS Ocean cluster.
Our ERDDAP server is public.

Another reason to use ERDDAP is that it provides access to the daily model results as continuous data streams,
hiding the fact that they are stored in per-day files.
ERDDAP makes it much easier to work with a dataset that spans multiple days because it removes the task of opening each day's file(s) and splicing the variable values into arrays.
You can just ask for a slice of the dataset in time and space and ERDDAP takes care of the slicing and splicing
(provided that the resulting dataset is less than 2Gb in size).

Another new development is the `xarray`_ package.
Quoting from the introduction to its documentation:

  **xarray** ... is an open source project and Python package that aims to bring the labeled data power of `pandas`_ to the physical sciences,
  by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.

  Our goal is to provide a pandas-like and pandas-compatible toolkit for analytics on multi-dimensional arrays,
  rather than the tabular data for which pandas excels.
  Our approach adopts the `Common Data Model`_ for self-describing scientific data in widespread use in the Earth sciences:
  :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` is an in-memory representation of a netCDF file.

.. _xarray: http://xarray.pydata.org/
.. _pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/
.. _Common Data Model: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/CDM

Here is a reworking of the `Exploring netCDF Files.ipynb`_ notebook using :kbd:`xarray`:

* `Exploring netCDF Datasets Using xarray.ipynb`_

.. _Exploring netCDF Datasets Using xarray.ipynb: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/analysis_tools/Exploring%20netCDF%20Datasets%20Using%20xarray.ipynb

`xarray`_ uses the `netCDF4-python`_ library so it is capable of accessing netCDF datasets from either local files or from ERDDAP servers.
The :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` object hides many of the low level details of the :py:class:`netcdf$.Dataset` objects to provide a more Pythonic interface to the dataset that is heavily inspired by `pandas`_. Like :kbd:`panada` variables,
:kbd:`xarray` variables have a :py:meth:`plot` method that makes quick visualization of datasets very easy.

:kbd:`xarray` provides sophisticated handling of the time coordinate of datasets.
In combination with ERDDAP that feature makes accessing arbitrary length time slices from the daily Salish Sea Nowcast system results collection very easy.

In summary,
you can think of ERDDAP as a higher level abstraction for storage of our model results,
and :kbd:`xarray` as a higher level abstraction for working with the results as Python objects.
The ERDDAP abstraction hides some of the discrete daily runs storage details,
and the :kbd:`xarray` abstraction hides some of the netCDF4 file structure details.
