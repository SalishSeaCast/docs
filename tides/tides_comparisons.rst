Progress on tidal comparisons
===========================================

Time series comparisons
--------------------------------------

Water level
*********** 

Measured water level observations at DFO stations can be compared to water level time series from NEMO
(see the ipython notebook tools/dfo_w_level/DFO_waterleveldownload.ipynb)

Currents
**********
 
Currents time series - have not looked into if this can be downloaded from  DFO yet

Harmonics comparisons
-------------------------------------------

Water level 
************

M2 and K1 harmonics calculated from measured water level (calculated and shown by Foreman et al (1995))  can be compared to harmonics calculated inside NEMO model

Other constituents will have to be either requested from someone who has calculated them (e.g. Foreman) or calculated from time series using t_tide.

Currents
************

M2 and K1 harmonics calculated from current measurements (calculated and shown by Foreman et al (1995))  can be compared to harmonics calculated inside NEMO model

Other constituents will have to be either requested from someone who has calculated them (e.g. Foreman) or calculated from time series using t_tide.
