Notes about tides literature review
===================================

Foreman et al. (1995) 
Used tidal data at 38 sites, subsampled from a list of 90 tidal stations (taken from Parker 1977) to only include stations with more than 120 days of records. 

'For tidal heights the amplitudes and phases of the eight major constituents at each site were calculated through harmonic analysis [Foreman,1977] of the observed time series' (Foreman et al 1995) 

'As discussed and illustrated by Foreman and Walters [1990], the harmonics calculated from the observations are only estimates of the true tides.' (Foreman et al 1995)

NOAA tide gauges - none in BC (all in Oregon and WA)
amplitude, phase and spring-neap variability of tidal signals
ratios of modeled to observed amplitudes of M2, S2 and K1 constituents using Pawlowicz et al (2002) - better skill at diurnal frequencies
(at semi-diurnal frequencies, modeled amplitude was too low)
Skill Score (SS)
