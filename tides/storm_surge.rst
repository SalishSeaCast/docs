Storm surge
======================================================================================================

We need to test our model to see how well it can represent storm surge events in the Salish Sea. We have wind forcing available from 2002-2010, so storms need to be in this period.

What classifies as a storm?
--------------------------------------

How long is a storm? What is the water level elevation during a storm? Does the storm affect the whole domain or does it not matter?


How to find storms?
--------------------------------------

e.g. looking through timeseries of difference between expected and measured 

e.g. literature search for big storms


Existing storm surge models
---------------------------------------

The Government of British Columbia launched the `BC Storm Surge Forecast System <http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/cas/adaptation/storm_surges.html>`_ in 2011. This model is driven by the Pacific Ocean Model (which is driven by 7 day weather forecasts from NOAA) and a 6 day forecast from Environment Canada. Forecast bulletins are available for Point Atkinson, Victoria and Campbell River. There is no hindcasting avaiable in the model.
