.. _team-repos:

Organization of Mercurial Repositories
======================================

General
-------

* The central location for all repos is the `SalishSea-MEOPAR team account`_ on Bitbucket

  .. _SalishSea-MEOPAR team account: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/

* People are free to push changes to code and docs that they own,
  but they should fork repos and create pull requests to provide changes to stuff owned by others so that changes are reviewed

* All repos have issue trackers enabled on Bitbucket

* Bitbucket wikis are disabled on all repos to force documentation into repo docs directories

* Docs use Sphinx_

  .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

* Docs from public repos will be rendered as HTML on `readthedocs.org`_.
  readthedocs also provides PDF rendering.

  .. _readthedocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/profiles/salishsea/

* There is no provision for rendering docs from private repos.

.. note::
    This was the project's original repo of initial conditions, forcing, etc. files.

    It also contained multiple copies large binary files which are no longer used.
    Together,
    these factors make this repo very time consuming to clone and update.
    In August 2017 the repo was split into 4 smaller repos:

    * :ref:`grid-repo`
    * :ref:`rivers-repo`
    * :ref:`tides-repo`
    * :ref:`tracers-repo`
