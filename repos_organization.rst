.. _team-repos:

Organization of Mercurial Repositories
======================================

General
-------

* The central location for all repos is the `SalishSea-MEOPAR team account`_ on Bitbucket

  .. _SalishSea-MEOPAR team account: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/

* People are free to push changes to code and docs that they own,
  but they should fork repos and create pull requests to provide changes to stuff owned by others so that changes are reviewed

* All repos have issue trackers enabled on Bitbucket

* Bitbucket wikis are disabled on all repos to force documentation into repo docs directories

* Docs use Sphinx_

  .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

* Docs from public repos will be rendered as HTML on `readthedocs.org`_.
  readthedocs also provides PDF rendering.

  .. _readthedocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/profiles/salishsea/

* There is no provision for rendering docs from private repos.

.. _analysis-repo:

analysis
~~~~~~~~

* public, read-only
* Apache v2.0 license, copyright project contributors and UBC
* analyses of the results of the Salish Sea MEOPAR NEMO model;
  most of the files are Jupyter Notebooks
* Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/

.. note::
    This was the project's original analysis repo.
    It got so big that it was in danger of hitting the Bitbucket 2Gb limit at which changeset would no longer be accepted.
    In April 2016 it was split into a collection of personal analysis repos for each team member,
    as well as some other application-specific analysis repos.
    They are all public with the same license and copyright a the original analysis repo.
    They can be found in the `SalishSea-MEOPAR Analysis project`_ collection of repos on Bitbucket.
