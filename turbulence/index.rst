Turbulence and Viscosity
************************
Configuring NEMO to model the Salish Sea requires careful consideration of the appropriate turbulence models and parameterizations. Vertical mixing is an important physical mechanism within the Strait of Georgia. A discussion on the lateral and vertical dynamics associated with mixing is provided here, as well as justifications for the choice of several model parameters and parameterizations.
