Model Configuation, Evaluation, and Storm Surge Hindcasting
===========================================================

The Salish Sea NEMO model configuation and its ability to calculate
tides and sea surface height was evaluated by hindcasting storm surge events
that occurred between 2002 and 2011 in:

    of water between Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia
    connected to the Pacific Ocean via Juan de Fuca Strait at the south and
    Johnstone Strait at the north. During the winter months, coastal communities
    along the Strait of Georgia are at risk of flooding caused by storm surges,
    a natural hazard that can occur when a strong storm coincides with high tide.
    This investigation produces storm surge hindcasts using a three-dimensional
    numerical ocean model for the Strait of Georgia and the surrounding bodies
    of water (Juan de Fuca Strait, Puget Sound, and Johnstone Strait)
    collectively known as the Salish Sea. The numerical model employs the
    Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean architecture in a regional
    configuration. The model is evaluated through comparisons of tidal elevation
    harmonics and storm surge with observations. Important forcing factors
    contributing to storm surges are assessed. It is shown that surges entering
    the domain from the Pacific Ocean make the most significant contribution
    to surge amplitude within the Strait of Georgia. Comparisons between
    simulations and high-resolution and low-resolution atmospheric forcing
    further emphasize that remote forcing is the dominant factor in surge
    amplitudes in this region. In addition, local wind patterns caused a slight
    increase in surge amplitude on the mainland side of the Strait of Georgia
    compared with Vancouver Island coastal areas during a major wind storm on
    15 December 2006. Generally, surge amplitudes are found to be greater within
    the Strait of Georgia than in Juan de Fuca Strait.</p>",

Carbon Chemistry and Aragonite Saturation State
===============================================

The seasonal variability of aragonite saturation and pH in the surface
Strait of Georgia and their drivers were determined using a 1-D coupled
biochemical-physical model in:

        abstract = "<p>Declines in mean ocean pH and aragonite saturation state (ΩA)
    driven by anthropogenic CO2 emissions have raised concerns regarding the trends
    of pH and ΩA in estuaries. Low pH and ΩA can be harmful to a variety of marine
    organisms, especially those with calcium carbonate shells, and so may threaten
    the productive ecosystems and commercial fisheries found in many estuarine
    environments. The Strait of Georgia is a large, temperate, productive estuarine
    system with numerous wild and aquaculture shellfish and finfish populations.
    We determine the seasonality and variability of near-surface pH and ΩA in the
    Strait using a one-dimensional, biophysical, mixing layer model. We further
    evaluate the sensitivity of these quantities to local wind, freshwater, and
    cloud forcing by running the model over a wide range of scenarios using
    12 years of observations. Near-surface pH and ΩA demonstrate strong seasonal
    cycles characterized by low pH, aragonite-undersaturated waters in winter
    and high pH, aragonite-supersaturated waters in summer. The aragonite
    saturation horizon generally lies at ∼20 m depth except in winter and during
    strong Fraser River freshets when it shoals to the surface. Periods of strong
    interannual variability in pH and aragonite saturation horizon depth arise in
    spring and summer. We determine that at different times of year, each of wind
    speed, freshwater flux, and cloud fraction are the dominant drivers of this
    variability. These results establish the mechanisms behind the emerging
    observations of highly variable near-surface carbonate chemistry in the
    Strait.</p>",

Turbulence and Advective Mixing
===============================

The sensitivity of the deep water renewal into the Strait of Georgia
and of fresh water pulses into Juan de Fuca Strait to modelling choices
affecting both turbulence and advection has been determined in:
